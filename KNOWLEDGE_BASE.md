## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Common Issues

**Q: I can't find a specific booking. How do I search?**
A: Use the search function in the bookings section. You can search by guest name, booking reference, room number, or date range.

**Q: A room shows as "dirty" but housekeeping says it's clean. What should I do?**
A: Check the room status in the housekeeping dashboard. Staff may need to mark the room as complete in their system, or it may be awaiting inspection.

A: Check for early checkouts or rooms in cleaning status that might be available soon. You can also put guests on a waitlist and notify them when rooms become available.

**Q: The system is running slowly. What can I do?**
A: Clear your browser cache and cookies. If the issue persists, contact support as there may be server maintenance or updates in progress.

**Q: I accidentally deleted important data. Can it be recovered?**
